## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Boluwatife Sokan, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, graduating in December 2025. I have was born in Ashland, KY, however I grew up in South London, England. I am Nigerian by ethnicity and Nigerian culture is the biggest and most significant part of my culture and identity. 

I have always been passionate about music, sports, travelling and more. As I grew up in a Christian household and being in church oftern, I have been surrounded by music from a young, starting with drums at the age of 7 and picking up bass a few years later. Sports has also always come naturally to me and I played basketball and football/soccer competitively before moving across the pond for university. 

Engineering was perfect for me becuase I have been curious about how things worked from when I could form my first memories. Years down the line I am grateful to have to opportunity to earn in degree in mechanical engineering and will take that passion to hopefully pursue a career in the aerospace, automotive or other technological industries.
